<span size='small'>Move your hero to the shop, right click on your hero, and select 'Enter Shop'.</span>
<span color='#00FF00'>What should I buy?</span>
<span size='small'>The first time in the shop, buy upgrades, especially hitpoints.  Don't buy more than one weapon.</span>
<span color='#00FF00'>How do I get gold?</span>
<span size='small'>Killing a creep gives your team 4 gold.  Killing an enemy hero gives 20.</span>

<span size='small'>You spend one turn in limbo, then begin again in your home position.</span>
<span color='#00FF00'>What is the score counter for?</span>
<span size='small'>The higher the counter, the more powerful creeps your team will get.</span>
<span color='#00FF00'>What's a good strategy for a beginner?</span>
<span size='small'>Buy lots of hitpoints, stay on good terrain, kill mostly creeps, and work with your teammates.</span>
